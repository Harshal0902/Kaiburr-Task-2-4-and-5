# Kaiburr Task 2, 4 and 5

## Task 2. Swagger codegen.

Create the same REST API as in task #1, but use https://editor.swagger.io/ to create your API definition and generate the server code. Choose any java-based server or server framework, that you like. You can either use the online editor or generate the code manually, e.g. using this document: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/server-stub-generator-howto. Make sure that you can deploy/run the generated code. Once your stub is ready - implement the same functionality as described in task #1, but now in java. Finally, be sure that you can show how your application responds to requests using postman, curl or any other HTTP client.

### Solution:

- Created a new project in swagger editor.
- Added the code in the editor(Code in task2 folder).
- Output:
